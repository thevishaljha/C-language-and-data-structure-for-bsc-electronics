# C-language-and-data-structure-for-bsc-electronics
Here, I will share C language - codes, which is necessary for ECE or BSc Electronics Student , along with data structure. 
The syllabus is mentioned below :
# C Programming : 
C Programming Language: Introduction, Importance of C, Character set, Tokens, keywords,
identifier, constants, basic data types, variables: declaration & assigning values. Structure of
C program
 Arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators, assignment operators,
increment and decrement operators, conditional operators, bit wise operators, expressions
and evaluation of expressions, type cast operator, implicit conversions, precedence of
operators. 
Arrays-concepts, declaration, accessing elements, storing elements, twodimensional and multi-dimensional arrays. Input output statement and library functions
(math and string related functions).
Decision making, branching & looping: Decision making, branching and looping: if, if-else,
else-if, switch statement, break, for loop, while loop and do loop. Functions: Defining
functions, function arguments and passing, returning values from functions.
 Structures: defining and declaring a structure variables, accessing structure members,
initializing a structure, copying and comparing structure variables, array of structures, arrays
within structures, structures within structures, structures and functions. Pointers.
 Introduction to C++: Object oriented programming, characteristics of an object-oriented
language.
# Data Structures :
Data Structures: Definition of stack, array implementation of stack, conversion of infix
expression to prefix, postfix expressions, evaluation of postfix expression. Definition of
Queue, Circular queues, Array implementation of queues. Linked List and its
implementation, Link list implementation of stack and queue, Circular and doubly linked list.
Searching and sorting: Insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, linear Search,
binary search. Trees : Introduction to trees, Binary search tree, Insertion and searching in a
BST, preorder, postorder and inorder traversal (recursive)

 # Praticals or Projects :

1. Generate the Fibonacci series up to the given limit N and also print the number of elements in
the series.
2. Find minimum and maximum of N numbers.
3. Find the GCD of two integer numbers.
4. Calculate factorial of a given number.
5. Find all the roots of a quadratic equation Ax2 + Bx + C = 0 for non – zero coefficients A, B and C.
Else report error.
6. Calculate the value of sin (x) and cos (x) using the series. Also print sin (x) and cos (x) value using
library function.
7. Generate and print prime numbers up to an integer N.
8. Sort given N numbers in ascending order.
9. Find the sum & difference of two matrices of order MxN and PxQ.
10. Find the product of two matrices of order MxN and PxQ.
11. Find the transpose of given MxN matrix.
12. Find the sum of principle and secondary diagonal elements of the given MxN matrix.
13. Calculate the subject wise and student wise totals and store them as a part of the structure.
14. Maintain an account of a customer using classes.
15. Implement linear and circular linked lists using single and double pointers.
16. Create a stack and perform Pop, Push, Traverse operations on the stack using Linear Linked list
17. Create circular linked list having information about a college and perform Insertion at front,
Deletion at end.
18. Create a Linear Queue using Linked List and implement different operations such as Insert,
Delete, and Display the queue elements.
19. Implement polynomial addition and subtraction using linked lists.
20. Implement sparse matrices using arrays and linked lists.
21. Create a Binary Tree to perform Tree traversals (Preorder, Postorder, Inorder) using the concept
of recursion.
22. Implement binary search tree using linked lists. Compare its time complexity over that of linear
search.
23. Implement Insertion sort, Merge sort, Bubble sort, Selection sort.
